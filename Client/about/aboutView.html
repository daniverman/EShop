           <h1 align=bottom > Our Difficulties</h1>

            <p> • It is difficult to plan the whole system and all its functions in advance.<br>
               • There is difficulty in trying to formulate a correct demand that represents my will and will not allow the programmer to understand something <br>
                •There is a difficulty in that as a customer who does not have technical knowledge, I do not know what is possible to ask for and what is not, and the client is not exposed to any technological options he might want to use.  • There is a difficulty when there are unclear requirements and then as a programmer I should try to guess what the client wanted
                • Not every customer requirement is technically feasible
                • There are requirements that affect each other so sometimes you have to go back and update old functions. </p>
